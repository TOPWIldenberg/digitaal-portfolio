            <h1>Hi, on this page i am going to tell you about my vision on the future and what i want to do after this education.</h1>
            <p> My vision? </p>
            <p>My vision of the future is not really clear yet to be honest.
              I do really like to code and programme ,but my origional idea was to do a MBO4 education so i could do HBO.
              On HBO i would study Mathmathics so that after my HBO i could become a math teacher, But the more i code the more i like it. so i wont be suprised if i want
            to stay here and keep coding and creating stuff. If not? Well then i will become a teacher on a highschool. someone ask me a couple of days ago; "Terrence if
            you want to become a math teacher why wont you do a math education right away?". This questin is not so hard my awnser was simple, I want to be someone who
          is good in more than one thing so that if i ever change my mind i can.</p>
          <p> So my future.</p>
          <p> So or i will study Mathmatics on the HBO and i become a teacher, or i wont and i will become a programmer.
            Who knows.</p>
